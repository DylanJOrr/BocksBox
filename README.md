# BocksBox
A mealkit and ready-made-meal hybrid delivery service create with react and bootstrap as a school project.

# Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make sure you have node.js installed (I am using the latest version)
3. While I recommend installing `pnpm`, `yarn` or the default `npm` will do
4. Open the downloaded project, make sure you are in the root directory, and then run `pnpm install` (Or otherwise for `yarn`, `npm`, etc.)
  - This should install all of the dependencies stored in the package.json file
5. I was unable to get a proper database fully working. The prisma schema can be found in `prisma/schema.prisma`
6. In a terminal in the root of the project, run `pnpm run dev`.
  - This will open the website in a local dev session, and it will tell you what the address it's running on.
7. Test to your heart's content!
